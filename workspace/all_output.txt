Here's a simple implementation of a "Hello World" console application in C#:

```cs
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

This will print "Hello World!" to the console screen when ran.

Explanation:
1. The `using` directive is used to import the System namespace which contains the `Console` class.
2. The `namespace` keyword is used to declare a namespace named `HelloWorld`.
3. Inside the namespace, a class named `Program` is declared.
4. Inside the class, a method named `Main` is declared. The `Main` method is the entry point of a console application.
5. Inside the `Main` method, the `Console.WriteLine` statement is used to print "Hello World!" to the console screen.
