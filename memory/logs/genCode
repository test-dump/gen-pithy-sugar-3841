The `using` directive is used to import the System namespace which contains the `Console` class.\n2. The `namespace` keyword is used to declare a namespace named `HelloWorld`.\n3. Inside the namespace, a class named `Program` is declared.\n4. Inside the class, a method named `Main` is declared. The `Main` method is the entry point of a console application.\n5. Inside the `Main` method, the `Console.WriteLine` statement is used to print \"Hello World!\" to the console screen."}]
